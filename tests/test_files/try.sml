(* This provides a syntactically lightweight analog to the failure (option) monad.
 * We implement failure using a canonical exception, and provide combinators
 * for mediating between failure via exception ('a t) and failure via the option 
 * type ('a option).  
 * The type 'a t is purely for documentation purposes.  It marks combinators 
 * which may raise the failure exception instad of returning a value.
 * 
 * CODING CONVENTIONS
 * This module provides syntactic convenience, at the expense of not preventing
 * abusive uses.  For clarity of code, it is generally best to avoid propogating
 * failure inter-procedurally.  The intended use is that failure via exception 
 * ('a t) is used to escape from a function body, but that failure via the option
 * type is used to communicate between functions.
 * Another way of saying this is that the only user code with type 'a -> 'b t
 * should occur syntactically as an argument to Try.try or one of the other
 * combinators that wrap up failure via exception as failure via the option type.
 *)

  (* This combinator takes a function which fails (via exceptions) and reifies the
   * result into the option type by representing failure as NONE, and sucess with
   * result A as SOME A.  All failing user code should be a syntactic argument
   * to this combinator (or one of it's variants)
