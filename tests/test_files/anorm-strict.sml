(*
 * ANormStrict is a strict variation of A-normal form with
 * explicit thunks and effect annotation.
 *
 * In addition to side effects in ANormLazy, non-termination
 * (or partial) is also considered as an effect. But we only 
 * annotate each App because:
 * 1. The effect of PrimApp can be looked up from GhcPrimOp.
 * 2. The effect of ExtApp is assumed to any.
 * 3. The effect of thunk Eval is assumed to be partial.
