(************** Notes on usage ************************************************
 *
 * For notes on the general architecture of the IMil implementation and
 * how to modify it, see the comment at the top of imil-types.sml.
 *
 * Clients of the IMil should only access things exported through the
 * IMil structure directly, rather than through the structures defined
 * in the various imil-xxx.sml files.  The abstraction mechanism will
 * enforce this.  However, the signatures (interfaces) of the
 * sub-structures of the IMil are defined in the imil-xxx.sml files.  So
 * for example, one should look in the file imil-use.sml to find the signature 
 * IMIL_USE which classifies the IMil sub-structure for uses:
 *
 *  structure Use : IMIL_USE
 *
 * Each such signature has the form:
 *
 *  signature IMIL_VAR = 
 *  sig
 *    include IMIL_PUBLIC_TYPES 
 *    ....
 *  end
 *
 * The "include IMIL_PUBLIC_TYPES" line can be ignored - it simply
 * includes some types into the signature for clarity and for coherence
 * purposes.  The rest of the signature declares all of the public
 * exports of the structure.
 *
