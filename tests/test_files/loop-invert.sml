 * Loop inversion: transform while-do loop to do-while loop.
 *
 * The control flow graph of a while-do loop looks like this,
 * where R1, R2, RC are code regions.
 *
 *         |
 *         v
 *     --> R1
 *     |   | \
 *     |   |  \
 *     |   v   v
 *     ---R2   RC

 * The goal is to duplicate R1 to R1', and re-wire the program
 * as follows:
 *
 *         |
 *         v
 *         R1-
 *         |  \
 *         |   \
 *         v    v
 *     --->R2   RC
 *     |   |    ^
 *     |   |   /
 *     ---R1'-/
 *
 * This is a a pre-step for loop invariant code motion, where
 * invariants can be safely moved out of a do-while loop.
 *
 * Another advantage is that RC can now be arranged to immediately
 * follow the code block of R1' so that there is no more jump
 * when the runtime execution exit the loop body (compared
 * to the original diagram, where there are two jumps when
 * we exit the loop, namely R2 -> R1 and R1 -> RC).
 *
 * To maintain SSA property, we must ensure that variables defined
 * in R1 are renamed in R1', and R2 and RC must receive these
 * variables as block parameters (and hence also renamed accordingly).
 *
 * Our actual algorithm works on the dominator tree structure.
 * At the moment, it only handles while loops where:
 *
 *   1. there is exactly one R2 (s.t. it is a while-do loop);
 *   2. there is one or no RC;
 *   2. R2 and RC have only one entry;
 *   4. R1 contains no loop.
 *
 * We make use of an important property of dominator tree, i.e.,
 * that all leaves either
 *
 *   1. return, or
 *   2. exit to an ancestor (thus forming a loop), or
 *   3. exit to a child of an ancestor.
 *
 * We first annotate all nodes in the dominator tree with a set
 * of its dominance frontiers, S(L), by the following formula:
 *
 *  S(L) = successors_in_CFG(L) + union of S(children(L)) - children(L)
 *
 * If an L itself is in S(L), then it's loop header.
 *
 * The we do a post-order traversal of the annotated tree, and
 * for each loop we must check whether it's a qualifying while-do
 * loop by first locating its RC region.
 *
 * We start from the loop header, and check its children:
 *
 *   1. if S(L) for a child L has something not in the sub-tree of
        the loop header (i.e., either returns or exits to something
        outside the loop tree), then it becomes a RC candidate.
 *
 *   2. if there are more than one RC candidates, we fail.
 *
 *   3. if there is only one RC candidate, and:
 *      a. if it only returns or exits to outside, we've found RC.
 *      b. otherwise, the RC candidate is an ancestor to the actual
 *         RC, and we iterate down its children from Step 1.
 *
 * After we find RC, we then identify R1 and R2:
 *   R2 = the only subtree that exits to loop header
 *   R1 = loop body - R2
 *
 * We need a sanity check before duplicating R1, e.g., R1 shall not
 * contain nested loops.
