     *    the cb of each code that returns to f or another included code or
     *    a return label in f or another included code.
     *    Second, in parts originally from a code that returns to label l,
     *    change return(os) to jump l'(os) and tailcall f(os) to
     *    call f(os) -> rvs'.l'' where l' is a newly created block of the
     *    form l'(rvs): goto l(), rvs are the return vars of l, and rvs' are
     *    copies of rvs.
     *    Third, rewrite the cuts to annotations on any included cb.  This
     *    is similar to inlining.  Anything that exits must have the labels
     *    of f that are used in RhsCont added to the target sets.
     *    Fourth, for each call to an inlined cb, change it to a jump to the
     *    cb's entry label, which must be transformed for closures and thunks
     *    to include the implicit argument and to load the free variables.
     *   For each GClosure and RhsClosureInit, if the code is not unknown
