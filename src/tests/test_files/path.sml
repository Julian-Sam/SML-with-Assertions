(* Utilities for dealing with different os path syntax *)

(* This is a simplified model of the OS path syntax that is 
 * intended to play nice with cygwin, and to be simpler to 
 * use and reason about.  It doesn't not support the full
 * generality of the Basis OS.Path facility (but does
 * deal with cygwin paths, unlike OS.Path).
 * 
 * The model of a path is as a volume and a series of links.
 * 
 * Volumes may be a drive letter (e.g. c) or they may be the
 * the special root volume.  
 *
 * An absolute path is one which has a volume.
 *
 * We deviate from the standard path model in that
 * we allow mixed seperators (that is, / \ in the same path).
 * This means that some valid (but odd) paths will be incorrectly
 * parsed (e.g. weird\file is a valid unix file name, but will be
 * treated as a path).
 *
 * Paths may be reifed as MingGW, Windows, Cygwin, or Unix path
 * strings.  Relative paths are valid for all three.  
 * An absolute path is valid for:
 *   Windows always
 *   Unix if the volume is root
 *   Cygwin always
 *   MinGW always
 * 
 * Examples:
 *   If volume is C and the links are ["documents and settings", "lpeterse"], 
 *    then the reifications are:
 *    Windows:  C:\documents and settings\lpeterse
 *    Unix: error
 *    Cygwin: /cygdrive/c/documents and settings/lpeterse
 *    MinGW: /c/documents and settings/lpeterse
 *
 *   If volume is root and the links are ["usr", "lib"],
 *    then the reifications are:
 *    Windows: \usr\lib
 *    Unix: /usr/lib
 *    Cygwin: /usr/lib
 *    MinGW: /usr/lib
 * 
 *)

  (* fromString tries to parse a path from the string.  This is necessarily heuristic.
   * For example, "C:\Documents and Settings" is technically a valid unix path (the relative
   * path designating a file of that name), and is also a valid windows absolute path.
   * The heuristic is simply to first try to parse the string as a windows path.  If this fails,
   * we try to parse it as a unix style path.  If the leading directories of this path
   * are /cygdrive/X for some character X, we treat X as the volume.  Otherwise we treat
   * it as a rooted path.
